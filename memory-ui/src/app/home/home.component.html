<h1>Welcome to the memory game!</h1>
<h4>Instructions:</h4>
<p>
	Navigate to the game via the icon in the top-right of your screen, and then select a difficulty.
	Note that starting a new game does overwrite your previous save.
	The save is stored in the locally running back-end server, mocking a database for simplicity's sake. 
	Otherwise, this would be stored in a database so that the data is not dependent on said server.
