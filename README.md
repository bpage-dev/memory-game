## Memory Game
#### Created by Ben Page

I am using:
Front End
* Angular: 9.1.11
* Node v12.18.0
Back End
* JDK 1.8
* Apache Maven 3.6.3
* Spring Boot 2.4

What I would do next:
* Refactor 'GameState' object to be cleaner and without redundancy
* Refactor game.component.ts to contain less logic, and condense similar logic lanes (eg different difficulties)
* Make the game's buttons and end-game popup prettier
* Implement a high(low) scores page
