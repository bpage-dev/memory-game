## Memory Game
#### Created by Ben Page

I am using:
* Angular: 9.1.11
* Node v12.18.0
* JDK 1.8
* Apache Maven 3.6.3
* Spring Boot 2.4

What I would do next:
* Fix mid-turn bug (not saving/loading everything needed to save & load mid turn)
* Refactor game.component.ts to contain less logic, and condense similar logic lanes (eg different difficulties)
* Make the game's buttons and end-game popup prettier
* Implement a high(low) scores page
